# MPG-Regression-Analysis
This directory contains code and resources for investigating regression models on a dataset related to car fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, or MPG). The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze the relationship between various features of cars and their MPG values using regression techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of a collection of cars and their corresponding attributes, such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. The target variable is the MPG, representing the fuel efficiency of each car.
